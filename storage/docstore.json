This \nappendix does not form part of the standar d specification.  Actions and considerations discussed in \nthis appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owner\u2019s design decisions \nand methodology.  \n \nDesigner Action/Considerations  \n \nThe designer should specify the following in the Contract Documents:  \n \n- Grade and compressive strength of the insulation.  (316.05.01)  \n \n- Excavation limits.  (316.07.02.01)  \n \n- Insulation thickness and area to be treated.  (316.07.03.01)  \n - Depth of  the initial lift of granular base or subbase material to be placed over the extruded expanded \npolystyrene to allow for construction traffic .  (316.07.04)  \n \nThe placing of extruded expanded polystyrene sheets over frost susceptible soil prevents the penetration of frost beyond a predetermined depth.  When it is decided to treat a frost heave without excavating, \npolystyrene is placed right on the surface of the existing pavement and covered with granular.  \n \nTypical thicknesses of the extruded expanded polystyrene treatments are 25 mm in Southern Ontario and \n40 mm in Northern Ontario.  Increasing the thickness of insulation may result in an increased risk of \ndifferential icing.  \n Due to differential icing concerns with extruded expanded polystyrene frost heave treatments, the designer \nshould consider limiting treatment to tangent sections avoiding curves, crests of hills, and intersections.  \n \nThe designer should ensure that the General Conditions of Contract and the 100 Series General \nSpecifications are included in the Contract Documents.  \n \nRelated Ontario Provincial Standard Drawings  \n \nOPSD 514.010  Extruded Expanded Polystyrene Frost Heave Treatment, 25 mm Thickness  \nOPSD 514.020  Extruded Expanded Polystyrene Frost H eave Treatment, 40 mm Thickness  \n \nNovember 2018  Page 6 of 6 OPSS.MUNI 316 \n ", "doc_id": "05ac2577-d588-4c1d-9c96-f6c335457672", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7b19905ff4cf5b77306ba910974689abcf4619041ba1b421e9e316a67329a7fc", "extra_info": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "OPSS.MUNI 316 Nov18.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2143, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "efe357f4-2706-4b4e-93f8-7ff82ba93f94"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "93d93f36-bdc9-4ae5-a082-059902acfd03": {"__data__": {"text": " \nNovember 2020  Page 1 of 13 OPSS.MUNI 320 \n  ONTARIO  \nPROVINCIAL  \nSTANDARD  \nSPECIFICATION  OPSS.MUNI 320  \nNOVEMBER 2020   \n \n \nCONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATION FOR  \nOPEN GRADED DRAINAGE LAYER  \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \n \n320.01  SCOPE  \n \n320.02  REFERENCES  \n \n320.03  DEFINITIONS  \n \n320.04  DESIGN AND SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS  \n \n320.05  MATERIALS  \n \n320.06  EQUIPMENT  \n \n320.07  CONSTRUCTION  \n \n320.08  QUALITY ASSURANCE  \n \n320.09  MEASUREMENT FOR PAYMENT  \n \n320.10  BASIS OF PAYMENT  \n \n \nAPPENDICES  \n \n320-A Commentary  \n \n \n \n320.01  SCOPE  \n \nThis specification covers the requirements for materials, construction, and testing of asphalt cement and \nPortland cement treated open graded drainage layer.  \n \n320.01.01  Specification Significance and Use  \n \nThis specification is written as a municipal -oriented specification.

OGDLs should be reviewed \nfor use on all major arterial and expressway projects with composite and concrete pavements and may be \nconsidered for de ep strength flexible pavements.  \n \nThe thickness of the OGDL should be 100 mm. The unit weight of OGDL is 1.7 t/m\u00b3. The OGDL is \nassigned the same structural value as a granular base.  \n \nDESIGN:  \nOGDL shall be drained by an edgedrain collector system, such as a conventional pipe subdrain backfilled \nwith OGDL aggregate, wrapped in geotextile, which is in direct contact with the OGDL.  \n \nDOCUMENTATION : \nOGDL locations are documented by station to station limits on Quantities - Hot Mix and Granular quantity \nsheet(s). T he calculated square metre quantity is entered in the appropriate column.  \n \n \nThe designer should ensure that the General Conditions of Contract and the 100 Series General \nSpecifications are included in the Contract Documents.  \n \n \nRelated Ontario  Provincial Standard Drawings  \n \nOPSD 207.041  Open Graded Drainage Layer with Subdrain Pipe, Paved Shoulders  \nOPSD 207.044  Subdrain Pipe Connections and Outlets, for Open Graded Drainage Layer  ", "doc_id": "906ec114-1888-4ab5-962a-d5301c3450da", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "efad2fb3391754d88326170d009eccd9a61e11c6587253cdbde12912ce98d3e7", "extra_info": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "OPSS.MUNI 320 - Nov 2020.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2309, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "a5a99126-29d2-41b6-9f05-e711d46de1a2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9018f8be-8f99-41fd-835a-e2b5b9101f30": {"__data__": {"text": "Page 1  Rev.

Actions and considerations \ndiscussed in thi s appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owner\u2019s \ndesign decisions and methodology.  \n \nDesigner Action/Considerations  \n \nThe designer should specify the following in the Contract Documents:  \n - The depths and widths for reclaiming exi sting asphalt pavement and underlying granular base.  \n(331.07.0 2) \n \n- The depth and limits of expanded asphalt stabilization.  ( 331.07.0 4) \n \nThe designer should determine if the following is required and, if so, specify it in the Contract Documents:  \n \n- Traffic convoy requirements.  ( 331.07.07)  \n \nExpanded asphalt mix (EAM) is a reclaimed asphalt pavement and granular base stabilized in- place by \nthe addition of expanded asphalt and,  if required, corrective aggregate and active filler . \n \nEAM is a bound material and does not exhibit the same drainage characteristics as granular base \nmaterial.  \n Expanded or \u201cfoamed\u201d asphalt is created by injecting a carefully metered amount of cold water into hot \nasphalt cement in the mixing chamber of a pulverizer -stabilizer.  The as phalt expands, reducing the \nviscosity of the asphalt cement and allowing easier dispersion throughout the mix.  \n \nThe expanded asphalt bonds most effectively with finer aggregate particles forming a mortar to bond the \ncoarser aggregate particles together.  T he stabilization process requires fines in order to be effective.  \n \nIt is recommended that adequate pre- engineering be carried out on the project and that existing \npavement thicknesses and composition be established.  Additional investigation should be carr ied out \nwhen pavement composition changes, such as patched areas.  Pre- engineering data should be included \nin the contract documentation.  \n \nThe selected performance graded asphalt cement (PGAC) must have suitable expansion characteristics.  \nPolymer modified PGAC may adversely affect the foaming process.  There is no requirement for a PGAC \nto be selected based on climatic zones, as the stabilized layer is expected to have good fatigue properties \nand should not be prone to low temperature cracking.  \n \nSince EAM has a higher structural equivalency than granular base material, it is suitable for pavement \nstrengthening purposes where aggregate availability is low or where elevation restrictions exist.  \n This specification requires that the EAM be paver laid, i.e., be placed by a self -propelled mechanical \npaver.  If an Owner would like the EAM to be grader laid, i.e., to allow the use of a grader to place the \nEAM, a special provision to allow that option should be included in the Contract Documents.  \n \nWhen additional full -depth reclamation is required beyond the limits of the expanded asphalt stabilization, \nthe depth and limits of full -depth reclamation should be clearly indicated in the Contract Documents.  \n(331.07.02)  \nPage 11 Rev.

Actions and considerations \ndiscussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owner\u2019s \ndesign decisions and methodology.  \n \nDesigner Action/Co nsiderations  \n \nThe designer should be aware of the following when selecting HIR:  \n \nHIR is limited to resurface pavements exhibiting only surficial distresses .  HIR should be considered for roads  \nwith the following distress manifestations:  \n \n- Very slight to moderate ravelling / coarse aggregate loss, segregation, very slight to moderate \nflushing, and/or distortions  \n \n- Few to frequent very slight to moderate non- working cracks  \n \n- For 2 lane highways up to 1.0% correction in crossfall can be achi eved across a single lane width \nusing HIR, provided there are no bridge clearance or grade raise restrictions  \n \n- For multi -lane highways correction of crossfall with HIR is not recommended \n \nHIR is not suitable for pavements exhibiting structural distresses , i.e.  alligator cracking, lack of structural \ncapacity, working cracks, severe distortions, and/or instability rutting.  HIR is not suitable for pavements \nexhibiting severe or very severe ravelling / coarse aggregate loss due to stripping.  \n \nHIR is not per mitted for use on bridge decks; therefore, if the contract contains multiple bridges that require \npaving, the designer should consider whether stopping and starting the HIR process at each bridge is \nacceptable for the contract .   \n \nHIR is recommended only f or existing flexible pavements, excluding SMA, with a minimum asphalt pavement \nthickness of 70 mm .  The specified HIR lift thickness is 40 mm to a maximum of 50 mm (including any \nbeneficiating HMA) .  The measured lift thickness is the actual lift thickness  of the HIR placed and may or may \nnot be equal to the hot milling depth .  A minimum of 25 mm of existing asphalt pavement should be \nmaintained below the HIR.  \n \nThe HIR process should not be used to recycle SMA or composite pavements.  \n HIR must be placed in warm, dry weather; and therefore, HIR contracts should be tendered so that  the HIR \nwork can be carried out between May 15th and October 15th, inclusive.  \n \nThe designer should note that HIR equipment may be restricted to a specific processing width.  The \nequipment is usually able to process a width of up to 4.0 m .  This could restrict the use of HIR with partially \npaved shoulders .  However, the placement width is similar to that of a conventional paver, and partially paved \nshoulders that cannot be removed along with the lane, due to the restricted processing width, could be \nremoved conventionally ahead of the HIR operation to allow the new partially paved shoulder to be placed in conjunction with the lane .

(333.07.01)  \n \n- Crossfall and grade.  ( 333.07.07) \n \n- Testing laboratory to carry out CIR moisture content and compaction testing.

(333.07.04)  \n \nIt is recommended that adequate pre -engineering be carried  out on the project and that existing \npavement thickne sses and composition be established.  Additional investigation  should be carried out \nwhere pavement composition changes, such as patched areas.   Pre-engineering data should be included \nin the Contract Documents.  \n \nCorrective aggregates are used when existing pavements are experiencing rutting, shoving, or flushing \nand it is suspected that the existing bituminous material is the cause of these distresses.  Corrective \naggregate may also be required to achieve mix design properties.  \n \nAny full depth repairs required for frost heave and distortion corrections should be repaired prior to CIR.  \n \nIn urban areas, the designer should be aware of appurtenance adjustment requirements, curb heights, \nand accessibility concerns to accommodate the CIR equipment train and the requirement for traffic \ndetours.  \n \nContract scheduling shou ld allow for CIR and follow -up paving to be completed within the time , \ntemperature , and operational constraints.  \n \nThe designer should be aware that severe distresses (e.g., significant alligator cracking, map cracking) \nmay create an abundance of oversize m aterial and remediation (e.g., pre -milling, pre -pulverizing) that \nmay need  to be addressed to meet gradation requirements.  \n ", "doc_id": "58dcdc4f-4f93-462d-a8ab-47be876a9aa1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5aa50c99c2563d49a9b14138227e407e1fdd0aee350e49327429b18de0dcb3a7", "extra_info": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "OPSS.MUNI 333 Nov15.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3068, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4eba4efa-ca69-484c-b21d-58ecee51204b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "795cb6d9-c6c6-43ae-9f19-b88d3bf9d7cd": {"__data__": {"text": "Page 14  Rev.

Actions and considerations \ndiscussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not  supersede an Owner\u2019s \ndesign decisions and methodology.  \n \nDesigner Action/Considerations  \n \nThe designer should specify the following in the Contract Documents:  \n \n- Type of asphalt modifier (i.e., emulsified asphalt or liquid asphalt modifier).  (334.05.02)  \n \n- Type of wearing surface.  (334.07.01)  \n \n- Crossfall and grade.  (334.07.04)  \n \n- Location of testing laboratory.  (337.07.06.01, 334.07.06.02, 334.07.06.03, 334.07.06.04)  \n \n- Replacement  HMA to be used.  (334.08.07)  \n \nThe designer should determine if the follo wing is required and, if so, specify it in the Contract Documents:  \n - The emulsified asphalt as either a mixing grade polymer modified high float emulsified asphalt or a mixing grade high float emulsified asphalt.  (334.05.02)  \n \n- Traffic convoy requirement s.  (334.07.07)  \n CRM can be a cost -effective paving material for structural improvement of low volume roads.  \n \nCRM is susceptible to moisture intrusion and ravelling, and must be sealed with a wearing surface.  \nTypically, cold recycled mix is overlain with a surface treatment or single lift hot mix overlay.  For higher \ntraffic volume application, multiple lifts of hot mix may be considered.  \n \nDesigner should be aware of when setting up quantities, due to the variability of RAP, field adjustment of \nthe quantit y of asphalt modifier may be required.  \n \nCurrently, there is no standardized mix design methodology for CRM.  \n \nDesigner should address the issue of RAP ownership and quality of RAP during the preparation of \ncontract specifications.  Identify who owns the RAP  and who is responsible for RAP quality.  \n \nCRM contracts should be tendered to allow for placement in warm summer months to achieve proper \ncuring of the CRM mat.  \n \nA single contract incorporating placement of CRM and wearing surface is recommended.  \n \nSince pa yment for the CRM is by the square metre, the designer should ensure that grade preparation is \npart of the CRM contract.  \n A tack coat is recommended prior to surfacing CRM with HMA.  \n When specifying liquid asphalts, the designer should consider the environmental aspects of the product.  \nPage 11  Rev.

Actions and considerations \ndiscussed in this appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owner\u2019s \ndesign  decisions and methodology . \n \nDesigner Action/Considerations  \n \nCold in -place recycling with expanded asphalt (CIREAM) is suitable for treating a wide range of pavement \ndistresses.  CIREAM can repair pavements exhibiting age; thermal, fatigue, or reflective c racking and \npreviously recycled pavements and is beneficial in mitigating reflective cracking.  CIREAM is not suitable \nfor pavements with extensive base or subbase problems, pavements containing steel slag, or pavements \nof insufficient strength.  \n The designer should specify the following in the Contract Documents:  \n - Depth of CIREAM.  (335.07.01)  \n - Grade and crossfall.  (335.07.07)  \n \n- Designated testing laboratory.  ( 335.07.0 8.02, 335.07.08 .03) \n \nThe designer should determine if the following is required and, if so, specify it in the Contract Documents:  \n \n- Additional items for milling or padding or both if significant crossfall deficiencies exist in the existing \npavement surface.  (335.07.04)  \n It is recommended that adequate pre- engineering be carried out on the project and that existing \npavement thicknesses and composition be established.  Additional investigation should be carried out when  pavement composition changes, such as patched areas.  Pre- engineering data should be included \nin the Contract Documents . \n Corrective aggregates are used when existing pavements are experiencing rutting, shoving, or flushing \nand it is suspected that the existing bituminous material is the cause of these distresses.  Corrective \naggregate may also be required to achieve mix design properties.  \n \nAny full depth repairs required for frost heave and distortion corrections should be repaired prior to \nCIREAM.  \n \nIn urban areas, the designer should be aware of appurtenance adjustment requirements, curb heights, \nand accessibility concerns to accommodate the CIREAM equipment train and the requirement for traffic \ndetours.  \n \nContract scheduling should allow CIREAM and follow -up pavement to be completed within the time and \noperational constraints.  \n \nThe designer should be aware that severe dist resses (e.g., significant alligator cracking, map cracking) \nmay create an abundance of oversize material and remediation (e.g., pre- milling, pre -pulverizing) needs \nto be addressed to meet gradation requirements.  \n \nThe designer should be aware that the lengt h of CIREAM paving operation may affect traffic \nmanagement.  \nPage 12  Rev.

Surface treatment, slurry surfacing,  or \nmicrosurfacing may be considered.  \n \nA tack coat is recommended prior to paving HMA wearing course.  \n QC requirements have been removed from this specification, as acceptance is based on QA testing.  If an \nOwner requires Contractor QC to confirm that the work meets the specification requirements, a special \nprovision detailing the required Contractor QC should be included in the Contract Documents.  \n \nThe payment clause for this specification is all inclusive.  Should a municipality desire to pay for correcti ve \naggregate, active filler, or asphalt cement separately, separate payment items are required.  \n \nIn times of volatile asphalt cement prices, on multi -year contracts, and on Contracts with greater than \n1,000 tonnes of paver laid CIREAM material, designers m ay consider using the MTO PGAC price index \nfor payment adjustment.  The MTO PGAC price index is available on the Ontario Ministry of \nTransportation website at www.raqs.mto.gov.on.ca, by clicking on Contractor, Contract Bulletin, Asphalt \nPrice Index.  The MTO PGAC price index is only a tool for qualifying PGAC prices and is not intended as \na standard asphalt cement price to be incorporated into the contract bid.  The MTO PGAC price index calculation for a given month takes in the average of the 4 weeks of the month and is published on the \nlast day of the month.  \n \nThe designer should ensure that the General Conditions of Contract and the 100 Series General \nSpecifications are included in the Contract Documents.  \n Related Ontario Provincial Standard Drawings  \n \nNo information provided here.  \nPage 13  Rev.

This \nappendix does not form part of the standard specification.  Actions and considerations discussed in \nthis appendix are for information purposes only and do not supersede an Owner\u2019s design decisions \nand methodology.  \n \nDesigner Action/Considerations  \n \nMicro -surfacing is a thin wearing course that seals the pavement surface and improves frictional resistance.  \nMicro -surfacing does not address structural deficiencies . \n \nThe designer should specify the following in the Contract Documents:  \n - Any existing pavement surfaces not requiring tack coat.  (336.07.03)  \n - If the application is to be one or two coats  (i.e., scratch and surface or only surface).  (336.07.04)  \n - Location of testing laboratory for sample delivery.  (336.08.01)  \n \n- Type of micro- surfacing.  (336.10.01)  \n \nIf verbal confirmation of the mix design review and compliance is acceptable or no mix desi gn review is \nrequired, the designer should consider deleting the requirement for the Contract Administrator to issue confirmation in writing that the mix design has been reviewed and meets the specified requirements.  \n(336.04.01.01)  \n \nFor projects with exte nsive intersection and urban work, the designer should consider deleting the \nrequirement for equipment capable of continuous placement operations  and allowing for a truck mounted \nunit.  (336.06.04)  \n \nCrack sealant is typically removed prior to micro- surfacing when the crack sealant shows signs of \ndeterioration or debonding.  Crack sealant that has been in place less than 1 year can interfere with the micro -surfacing operations.  For projects with exist ing crack sealant, the designer should determine if the \ncrack sealant should be left in place and if so, delete the requirement for the removal of the existing crack \nsealing material.  (336.07.03)  \n \nIf a thick scratch coat is anticipated, the designer may c onsider deleting the requirement for tack coat.   \n(336.07.03)  \n For projects with ruts greater than 13 mm, the designer should consider specifying the locations for the use of a rut -filling spreader box, including the locations for 2 passes of the rut fillin g spreader box.  (336.07.04)  \nWhen the average rut depth is greater than 20 mm, the designer should consider requiring a coarse \naggregate gradation (Type III gradation) for rut fill mix.  \n \nFor projects where a traffic convoy is not feasible or desired, the designer should consider deleting the \nrequirement for a traffic convoy.  (336.07.06)  \n \nIf the forms in Appendices 336- B, 336- C, or 336- D are to be used for submission purposes rather than the \nMTO forms, they need to be invoked by reference in the Contract Documents and a special  provision should \nbe written to delete the MTO forms from the specification.  \n \nTypically  two coats (i.e., scratch and surface coats) are specified to remove severe surface defects.  \n \nThis specification should not be used in areas with the prevalence of studded tires or where pavements \nexhibit high deflection.  \nNovember 2018  Page 14 of 21 OPSS.MUNI 336 \n ", "doc_id": "dbb47382-453f-4ceb-8e29-db1fc801f233", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b103f158aa7c00cef32aa6a31ecbbe47a52478d0a92093ef2ed6ad49b19a6e94", "extra_info": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "OPSS.MUNI 336 Nov18.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3347, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ad5b627f-93a4-4ab9-b643-e786e63a37d4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a220ed1-df95-4425-bf13-a5eba1391441": {"__data__": {"text": "Appendix 336- A \n \nType II micro -surfacing with Superpave 12.5 quality aggregate is used on local residential streets and low \nvolume arterial and collectors.

This \nappendix does not form part of the standard specification.  Actions and considerations discussed in \nthis appendix are for information purpos es only and do not supersede an Owner\u2019s design decisions \nand methodology.  \n \nDesigner Action/Considerations  \n \nThe designer should specify the following in the Contract Documents:  \n \n- Traffic category.  (337.05.02)  \n \nThe designer should determine if the following is required and, if so, specify it in the Contract Documents:  \n - Tack coat.  (337.07.03)  \n \n- Traffic convoy .  (337.07.11)  \n \nSlurry seal is specified to seal the surface, prevent ravelling, and improve frictional characteristics.  It is not \nintended to increase the structural strength of pavement.   Pavements that are structurally deficient or \nexhibiting severe distress should be sealed and distortions repaired prior to slurry seal application.   A \ndetailed pavement condition investigation should be carried out to determine the appropriateness of specifying slurry seal.  \n \nThe three generally accepted types of slurry seal are:  \n \nType I - is a fine gradation mix for sealing low volume residential road surfaces.  \n Type II - is a medium gradation mix used for sealing road surfaces on moderate volume residential road \nsurfaces.  \n \nType III - is a coarse gradation mix used to improve skid resistance on moderate volume municipal road \nsurfaces . \n Selection of slurry seal type is dependent on traffic volumes and surface friction requirements.  \n \nWhere slurry seal is considered for higher volume roadways, the use of a premium aggregate or micro -surfacing is recommended.  \n Normally, tack coat is not required unless the surface to be covered is extremely dry and ravelled or it  is \nconcrete or brick.  \n Traffic should be prohibited from the finished surface for a period of up to four hours to permit the slurry \nseal to cure.  This may necessitate a separate pay item for traffic control.  \n The designer should ensure that the General C onditions of Contract and the 100 Series General \nSpecifications are included in the Contract Documents.  \n \nRelated Ontario Provincial Standard Drawings  \n \nNo information provided here.  \n \nNovember 2018  Page 10 of 10 OPSS.MUNI 337  ", "doc_id": "ca52b013-6944-4209-8721-e7d790b36526", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ef59a44e62aa2db86b7c1376b789ba33c20165fe162d5741b3bac9ecf761eb69", "extra_info": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "OPSS.MUNI 337 Nov18.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2509, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "1280da8e-85bc-4f43-938b-d26e37bf8942"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ed10f1f-daaf-49f7-95b5-880435b703f2": {"__data__": {"text": " \nNovember 2021  Page 1 of 8 OPSS.MUNI 341 \n  ONTARIO  \nPROVINCIAL  \nSTANDARD  \nSPECIFICATION  \n \n \nCONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATION FOR  \nROUTING AND SEALING CRACKS IN HOT MIX ASPHALT PAVEMENT  \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \n \n341.01 SCOPE  \n \n341.02 REFERENCES  \n \n341.03 DEFINITIONS  \u2013 Not Used  \n \n341.04 DESIGN AND SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS  \n \n341.05 MATERIALS  \n \n341.06 EQUIPMENT  \n \n341.07 CONSTRUCTION  \n \n341.08 QUALITY ASSURANCE  \n \n341.09 MEASUREMENT FOR PAYMENT  \n \n341.10 BASIS OF PAYMENT  \n \n \nAPPENDICES  \n \n341-A Commentary  \n \n \n \n341.01 SCOPE  \n \nThis specification covers the work of routing existing cracks up to 20 mm in width and cleaning and sealing \nrouted and unrouted cracks in hot mix asphalt pavements with hot poured rubberized asphalt sealant \ncompound.  \n \n341.01.01  Specification Significance and Use  \n \nThis specification has been developed for use in municipal -oriented Contracts.

If an \nalternate material is required, this must be indicated in the Contract Documents.  \n \nThe designer should identify the thickness of the concrete slab to be rubblized and identify the type of \nembedded steel in the concrete slab.  \n \nPavement drainage systems including ditch, sub -drains, and outlets are to be staged so that they are \ninstalled and operational prior to rubblizing operations beginning.  \n \nOperations should be staged so that the lateral pavement edge support remains in place until the rubblizing \noperations are completed.  This is to ensure that the maximum impact energy is transferred to the concrete \nslab.  \n \nSince only construction traffic is permitted on the rubblized surface, tra ffic staging should be shown in the \nContract Documents.  \n \nThe designer should ensure that the General Conditions of Contract and the 100 Series General \nSpecifications are included in the Contract Documents.  \n \nRelated Ontario Provincial Standard Drawings  \n \nNo information provided here.  \n ", "doc_id": "b82af336-34b3-4372-8f70-024ba7006a42", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0c98d6e478a12a71315ad566e7d710b122a8e49f9fa81b53687267060afc455c", "extra_info": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "OPSS.MUNI 361 Nov19.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2836, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "06cf140b-8d89-4718-8cf0-1ef2d66853c5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e9e3dd7-662a-4274-9a74-fa66f1a6b8dd": {"__data__": {"text": "November 2021  Page 1 of 5 OPSS.MUNI 364 \n  ONTARIO  \nPROVINCIAL  \nSTANDARD  \nSPECIFICATION  \n \n \n \nCONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATION FOR  \nPARTIAL DEPTH REPAIRS IN CONCRETE PAVEMENT  \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \n \n364.01 SCOPE  \n \n364.02 REFERENCES  \n \n364.03 DEFINITIONS  \n \n364.04 DESIGN AND SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS - Not Used  \n \n364.05 MATERIALS  \n \n364.06 EQUIPMENT - Not Used  \n \n364.07 CONSTRUCTION  \n \n364.08 QUALITY ASSURANCE - Not Used  \n \n364.09 MEASUREMENT OF PAYMENT  \n \n364.10 BASIS OF PAYMENT  \n \n \nAPPENDICES  \n \n364-A Commentary  \n \n \n \n364.01 SCOPE  \n \nThis specification covers the requirements for partial depth repairs in concrete pavement and includes \nremoval of concrete, preparation of surfaces, placement of concrete , and forming joints associated with the \nrepairs.  \n \n364.01.01  Specification Significance and Use  \n \nThis specification is written as a municipal -oriented specification.

The \npurpose of cross -stitching is to maintain aggregate interlock, provide added reinforcement to cracks, and \nprevent horizontal and vertical movement of the concr ete crack and slab migration.
